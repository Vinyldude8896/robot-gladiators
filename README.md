# Robot Gladiators

### User Story

As a user I am looking for a quick simple game to pass 5 or ten minutes as a mental break, I would like an application that is easy to use does not require a great deal of concentration. When I start the game I want to be able to add my choic of Robot Name, and just fight through battles by simply typing commands.

### Features
This app allows you to play a robot battle simulator game with 3 rounds
This app will take input from the user on what they want to name their Robot.
The user will then be able to fight through 3 rounds or skip the round.
After each round you can choose to use a potion to increase heath, strength, etc.
After three rounds, if your robot survives you will be given a final score.
